### Part 1: Introduction to Hamiltonian Mechanics in Calculus of Variations

#### Transition from Lagrangian to Hamiltonian Formulation

After exploring the Legendre-Fenchel transform and its profound implications on the analysis of superlinear functions, our journey takes us to the domain of Hamiltonian mechanics. This realm offers a new perspective on dynamical systems, enriching our understanding of the calculus of variations and its applications.

#### Hamiltonian Mechanics: Key Concepts and Definitions

- **Hamiltonian Function:** For a given Lagrangian $L: [a, b] \times \Omega \times \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, with $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ being an open subset, the Hamiltonian $H: [a, b] \times \Omega \times \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ associated with $L$ is defined by:
  $$
  H(t, x, p) = \sup_{q \in \mathbb{R}^n} [\langle p, q \rangle - L(t, x, q)]
  $$
  for $(t, x, p) \in [a, b] \times \Omega \times \mathbb{R}^n$.

- **Uniform Superlinearity:** A Lagrangian $L$ is uniformly superlinear in its third variable if it satisfies $L(t, x, q) \geq \theta(\|q\|) - c$ for some $c \in \mathbb{R}_+$ and a non-negative function $\theta$ with $\lim_{r \to +\infty} \theta(r)/r = +\infty$.

- **Legendre Map:** The Legendre map of a $C^1$ Lagrangian $L$, denoted as $L$, transforms the original Lagrangian into a new function by applying the partial derivative with respect to the third variable:
  $$
  L(t, x, q) = (t, x, \partial_q L(t, x, q))
  $$

#### The Hamiltonian as a Generalized Legendre-Fenchel Transform

The Hamiltonian function can be viewed as an extension of the Legendre-Fenchel transform to Lagrangians dependent on additional variables $t$ and $x$, aside from $q$. It encapsulates the energy of the system and provides a powerful tool for analyzing dynamics through its maximization principle.

#### Hamiltonian and Action Minimization

- **Action Minimization Problem:** Consider the Lagrangian $L(x, q) = \frac{1}{2m}\|q\|^2 - V(x)$, which describes a particle of mass $m$ under a potential $V(x)$. The Hamiltonian for this system translates to $H(x, p) = \frac{1}{2m}\|p\|^2 + V(x)$, highlighting the system's total energy composed of kinetic and potential energies.

- **Soap Bubble Problem:** This problem, defined by the Lagrangian $L(x, q) = x\sqrt{1 + q^2}$, demonstrates the geometric nature of Hamiltonian mechanics. The Hamiltonian's computation involves maximizing the functional over $q$, elucidating the balance between curvature and tension in determining the soap bubble's shape.

#### Theoretical Implications and The Hamilton Equations

The Hamiltonian framework not only offers a method to compute the system's energy but also facilitates the derivation of Hamilton's equations. These equations provide a set of first-order differential equations that describe the evolution of a system's state, offering a clearer and often more tractable path to understanding system dynamics than the second-order Euler-Lagrange equations.

- **Hamilton's Equations:** For an extremal $\xi$ with associated $\eta(t) = \partial_q L(t, \xi(t), \xi'(t))$, the pair $(\xi, \eta)$ satisfies:
  $$
  \xi'(t) = \partial_p H(t, \xi(t), \eta(t)), \quad \eta'(t) = -\partial_x H(t, \xi(t), \eta(t))
  $$

#### Conclusion

The transition from Lagrangian to Hamiltonian mechanics marks a significant step in our exploration of the calculus of variations. The Hamiltonian approach not only offers a new lens to view dynamical systems but also enhances our ability to analyze and solve complex variational problems.

### Part 2: The Legendre Transform and Hamiltonian Dynamics

#### The Legendre Transform: Bridging Lagrangian and Hamiltonian

The Legendre Transform plays a crucial role in transitioning from the Lagrangian $L(t, x, q)$ formulation to the Hamiltonian $H(t, x, p)$ framework. This transformation is instrumental in unveiling the dual nature of mechanics, revealing the relationships between momenta and velocities, and energy forms.

- **Legendre Transform in Mechanics:** For a Lagrangian $L(t, x, q)$, the Legendre Transform is given by $L(t, x, q) = (t, x, \partial_q L(t, x, q))$, where $\partial_q L$ denotes the gradient of $L$ with respect to velocity $q$. This transformation maps the velocity space to the momentum space, laying the groundwork for Hamiltonian dynamics.

#### Properties of the Hamiltonian

The Hamiltonian, derived as a generalized Legendre-Fenchel transform of the Lagrangian with respect to the velocity variable $q$, inherits and extends the properties of superlinearity and convexity to a broader setting:

- **Superlinearity and Convexity:** The Hamiltonian $H(t, x, p)$ maintains the superlinearity and strict convexity in the momentum $p$, analogous to the Legendre-Fenchel transform. This property ensures the uniqueness of solutions to Hamilton's equations and guarantees the stability of the system's dynamics.

- **Bijectivity of the Legendre Map:** The Legendre map, under the conditions of $C^2$ strict convexity and uniform superlinearity, is a bijective $C^1$ diffeomorphism. This bijection allows for a one-to-one correspondence between the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formulations, ensuring that every point in the velocity space has a unique counterpart in the momentum space, and vice versa.

#### Hamilton's Equations: The Core of Hamiltonian Mechanics

Hamilton's equations form the backbone of Hamiltonian mechanics, providing a set of first-order differential equations that describe the evolution of the system in phase space:

- **Formulation of Hamilton's Equations:** For a system described by a Lagrangian $L$, the associated Hamiltonian $H$ gives rise to Hamilton's equations:
  $$
  \dot{x} = \partial_p H(t, x, p), \quad \dot{p} = -\partial_x H(t, x, p)
  $$
  These equations represent the temporal evolution of the position $x$ and momentum $p$, encapsulating the system's dynamics in a concise and elegant manner.

- **Link to Euler-Lagrange Equations:** Hamilton's equations can be derived from the Euler-Lagrange equations, providing an alternative yet equivalent formulation of the dynamics. This equivalence underscores the deep connections between Lagrangian and Hamiltonian frameworks, each offering unique insights into the system's behavior.

#### Examples Revisited: Action Minimization and Soap Bubble Problem

- **Action Minimization Reinterpreted:** In the context of Hamiltonian mechanics, the action minimization problem for a particle in a potential field is reinterpreted through Hamilton's equations, highlighting the conservation of energy and the trajectories' dependence on the Hamiltonian structure.

- **Soap Bubble Problem through Hamilton's Lens:** The soap bubble problem, when analyzed through the Hamiltonian framework, emphasizes the geometric nature of the problem. The Hamiltonian formulation reveals the interplay between curvature and constraints, guiding the formation of minimal surfaces.

#### Conclusion

Hamiltonian mechanics, enriched by the Legendre Transform and encapsulated in Hamilton's equations, offers a powerful and versatile framework for analyzing dynamical systems. This approach not only facilitates the solution of complex variational problems but also deepens our understanding of the principles governing the behavior of physical systems. Through examples like the action minimization and the soap bubble problem, we see the practical implications of Hamiltonian dynamics in elucidating the structure and evolution of diverse systems.


### Part 3: Solving Problems with Hamiltonian Dynamics

#### Advantages of Hamiltonian Formulation

Hamiltonian dynamics, articulated through Hamilton's equations, furnishes a robust framework for analyzing and solving problems in the calculus of variations and physics. Its strengths lie in the formulation's ability to:

1. **Convert High-Order ODEs to First-Order Systems:** Hamilton's equations transform second-order differential equations into systems of first-order equations, simplifying numerical methods and analytical techniques for solving dynamical systems.

2. **Conserve Energy:** The Hamiltonian, often representing the total energy, is conserved for closed systems. This conservation principle is a powerful tool for analyzing the motion without directly solving differential equations.

3. **Utilize Symmetries and Conservation Laws:** The Hamiltonian formulation leverages symmetries within a system to unearth conservation laws, courtesy of Noether's theorem, enabling the simplification of problems and identification of invariant quantities.

#### Application to Extremal Problems

Extremal problems in the calculus of variations, such as finding the path that minimizes action in classical mechanics, are naturally suited to Hamiltonian analysis. The Hamiltonian framework provides clarity and efficiency in approaching these problems:

- **Example Revisited: The Brachistochrone Problem:** While not discussed explicitly earlier, the Brachistochrone problem, seeking the quickest path under gravity, can be reformulated in Hamiltonian terms. This perspective offers insights into the conservation of energy along the path and the problem's symmetries.

- **Geodesics and Minimal Surfaces:** Hamiltonian dynamics extends to the study of geodesics on curved surfaces and the search for minimal surfaces, analogous to the soap bubble problem. The Hamiltonian's structure can reveal the underlying geometry and optimal paths or shapes.

#### Hamilton's Equations: A Deeper Dive

Hamilton's equations do more than just restate dynamics; they open the door to phase space analysis, where the state of a system is represented as points in a space defined by positions and momenta. This view facilitates:

1. **Phase Space Trajectories:** The evolution of systems is traced out in phase space, offering a visual representation of dynamics that highlights stability, periodic orbits, and chaotic behavior.

2. **Canonical Transformations:** Changes of variables that preserve the form of Hamilton's equations, known as canonical transformations, allow for simplification of problems and discovery of new conserved quantities.

#### Challenges and Computational Aspects

While the Hamiltonian approach offers numerous advantages, it also presents challenges:

- **Complexity in Non-Integrable Systems:** For systems that cannot be solved analytically (non-integrable systems), Hamiltonian mechanics requires sophisticated numerical methods for exploring dynamics.

- **Sensitivity to Initial Conditions:** In chaotic systems, small changes in initial conditions can lead to vastly different outcomes, necessitating precise numerical control and understanding of the system's sensitivity.


#### Conclusion

Hamiltonian dynamics, with its elegant formulation and profound implications, remains a central pillar in the understanding and application of the calculus of variations. Its ability to simplify complex problems, conserve essential quantities, and reveal the deep structure of physical laws makes it an invaluable tool in mathematics and physics. As we push the boundaries of science and engineering, the principles of Hamiltonian mechanics will undoubtedly continue to light the way.

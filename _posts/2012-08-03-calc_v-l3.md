### Calculus of Variations: Euler Equation and Convexity

### Part 1: Introduction to Calculus of Variations and Basic Problems

#### Calculus of Variations: Overview

Calculus of Variations is a branch of mathematical analysis that deals with optimizing functionals, which are mappings from a set of functions to the real numbers. This field finds its roots in classical mechanics, geometry, and more recently, in the calculus of operations and functional analysis.

#### Fundamental Problems

In our previous lecture, we introduced two fundamental problems in the Calculus of Variations:

1. **Fixed Endpoint Problem (C1 Minimization Problem):** Here, we are tasked with finding the curve that minimizes a given integral, with the curve's endpoints being fixed. Mathematically, for given endpoints $\xi_a, \xi_b \in \mathbb{R}^n$, we seek to minimize:
   $$\int_a^b L(t, \xi(t), \xi'(t)) \, dt$$
   where $\xi \in C^1([a, b]; \mathbb{R}^n)$ and $\xi(a) = \xi_a, \xi(b) = \xi_b$.

2. **Bolza Problem:** This problem extends the fixed endpoint problem by adding an initial cost function $\phi_a$. For a given $\xi_b \in \mathbb{R}^n$, we aim to minimize:
   $$\int_a^b L(t, \xi(t), \xi'(t)) \, dt + \phi_a(\xi(a))$$
   with $\xi \in C^1([a, b]; \mathbb{R}^n)$ and $\xi(b) = \xi_b$.

#### Necessary Conditions: Euler Equation

For both problems, a local minimizer $\xi$ must satisfy the Euler Equation:
$$\frac{d}{dt} \frac{\partial L}{\partial \xi'}(t, \xi(t), \xi'(t)) = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \xi}(t, \xi(t), \xi'(t))$$

Additionally, in the Bolza problem, the minimizer must fulfill the Transversality Condition:
$$\frac{\partial L}{\partial \xi'}(a, \xi(a), \xi'(a))=D\xi(a) \phi_a$$

#### Extremals

A curve $\xi$ satisfying the above conditions (excluding the transversality condition for the fixed endpoint problem) is termed an extremal for the Lagrangian $L$. The concept of a $C^1$ extremal emphasizes that both $\xi$ and the map $t \rightarrow \frac{\partial L}{\partial \xi'}(t, \xi(t), \xi'(t))$ are continuously differentiable over $[a, b]$.

#### Example: The Action Minimization Problem

Consider a particle moving under a conservative force $F(\xi(t)) = -\nabla V (\xi(t))$. The "action" to minimize is:
$$J(\xi) = \int_{t1}^{t2} \left(\frac{1}{2}m\xi'(t)^2 - V(\xi(t))\right) dt$$
The Lagrangian $L(x, q) = \frac{1}{2}mq^2 - V(x)$ leads to the Euler equation reflecting Newton's law:
$$m\xi''(t) = -\nabla V (\xi(t))$$

This introduction sets the stage for exploring the calculus of variations further, highlighting its foundational problems, necessary conditions for optimality, and illustrating these concepts with a classical physics example. The coming sections will delve deeper into the calculus of variations, extending these concepts and introducing more complex scenarios and solutions.




### Part 2: Extension to $C^*$ Curves and the Integral Euler Equation

#### Limitations of $C^1$ Curves

While the class of $C^1$ curves is suitable for many problems in the calculus of variations, it does not encompass all possible scenarios we might encounter. Some problems require consideration of a broader class of curves, leading us to introduce the concept of $C^*_1$ curves. These are curves that may not be continuously differentiable everywhere but are piecewise so, allowing for a wider range of solutions to variational problems.

#### Example Demonstrating $C^*_1$ Necessity

Consider a Lagrangian defined on $[−1, 1] \times \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}$ by $L(t, x, q) = x^2(q − 1)^2$ with initial and final costs $\phi_{−1} = \phi_1 = 0$. The goal is to minimize the integral of $L$ subject to specific boundary conditions. This problem showcases that certain variational problems may not have a solution within the class of $C^1$ functions but do have solutions in the broader class of $C^*_1$ functions.

#### The $C^*_1$ Minimization Problem

To address problems that $C^1$ curves cannot solve, we extend our study to the $C^*_1$ minimization problem with fixed endpoints and the $C^*_1$ Bolza problem. The essence of these problems remains the same as their $C^1$ counterparts, but they are set in the context of the $C^*_1$ class, thus allowing for discontinuities in the first derivative of the curves under consideration.

#### Integral Euler Equation for $C^*_1$ Curves

For $C^*_1$ curves, the Euler equation adapts to account for potential discontinuities in the derivative of the curve. This leads to the Integral Euler Equation, which, for a given Lagrangian $L$, states that a local minimizer $\xi$ must satisfy:
$$\frac{\partial L}{\partial q}(t, \xi(t), \xi'(t)) = c + \int_a^t \frac{\partial L}{\partial x}(s, \xi(s), \xi'(s)) \, ds$$
for all $t \in [a, b]$, where $c$ is a constant vector in $\mathbb{R}^n$.

This integral form of the Euler equation is particularly suited for $C^*_1$ problems, offering a more general criterion for identifying extremals, i.e., curves that potentially minimize the action, even when classical $C^1$ analysis fails to provide a solution.

#### Examples and Applications

1. **Action Minimization Revisited:** The motion of a particle subject to a conservative force can be re-examined under the $C^*_1$ framework. The Integral Euler equation reaffirms that the extremals of the action functional are indeed the trajectories of the particle that adhere to Newton's law of motion.

2. **Existence of Global Minimizers:** A significant result in the calculus of variations for $C^*_1$ curves is that if the Lagrangian $L$ is convex in its arguments, any $C^*_1$ extremal satisfying the boundary conditions and the Integral Euler equation is a global minimizer. This provides a powerful tool for proving the existence of solutions to variational problems.

3. **The Length Minimization Problem:** The problem of finding the shortest path between two points in a plane can be formulated as a $C^*_1$ minimization problem. The Integral Euler equation shows that the minimizers are straight lines, highlighting the principle that the shortest distance between two points is a straight line, even within the broader context of $C^*_1$ curves.

### Conclusion of Part 2

Extending the study of variational problems to $C^*_1$ curves opens the door to solving a wider array of problems that are not addressable with $C^1$ curves alone. Through the Integral Euler Equation, we gain a robust framework for identifying potential minimizers, exploring the behavior of physical systems, and understanding the geometric nature of variational problems. This extension not only broadens the scope of the calculus of variations but also deepens our understanding of the principles underlying the optimization of functionals.


### Part 3: Convexity, Global Minimizers, and Applications

#### Convexity and its Role in Variational Problems

In the calculus of variations, convexity plays a pivotal role in ensuring the existence of global minimizers for a given problem. Specifically, if the Lagrangian $L(t, x, q)$ is convex in the variables $x$ and $q$ for any fixed $t$, this property can significantly simplify the analysis of variational problems by ensuring that any local minimizer is also a global minimizer.

#### The Lemma on Convex Functions

A foundational result underpinning the importance of convexity in the calculus of variations is the lemma on convex functions. It states that if $f: \mathbb{R}^m \to \mathbb{R}$ is a convex function and $x$ is a differentiability point of $f$, then for all $y \in \mathbb{R}^m$,
$$f(y) - f(x) \geq D_x f \cdot (y - x),$$
where $D_x f$ is the derivative of $f$ at $x$. This inequality is crucial for establishing that extremals satisfying the Euler-Lagrange conditions are indeed global minimizers when the Lagrangian is convex.

#### Global Minimizers in $C^*_1$ Problems

Building on the lemma of convex functions, we can prove that for any $C^*_1$ curve $\xi$ that satisfies the Integral Euler equation and whose associated Lagrangian is convex, $\xi$ must be a global minimizer for the variational problem. This is a powerful result, as it assures us that finding an extremal (a solution to the Integral Euler equation) is sufficient to solve the optimization problem when convexity is present.

#### Example: The Length Minimization Problem Revisited

A classic application of these principles is the length minimization problem, where the goal is to find the shortest path between two points. The Lagrangian for this problem, $L(t, x, q) = \sqrt{1 + q^2}$, is convex in $q$. According to our previous discussions, any $C^*_1$ extremal satisfying the boundary conditions is a global minimizer. In this case, the extremals are straight lines, illustrating the geometric principle that the shortest distance between two points is a straight line.


#### Conclusion of Part 3

The calculus of variations offers a rich framework for addressing a wide range of optimization problems across mathematics, physics, and engineering. Convexity of the Lagrangian is a key factor that simplifies the analysis and ensures the existence of global minimizers. Through the Integral Euler equation and the conditions for convexity, we can solve variational problems even when the solution space is broadened to include $C^*_1$ curves. These concepts not only provide powerful analytical tools but also deepen our understanding of the underlying principles governing natural phenomena and geometric structures.

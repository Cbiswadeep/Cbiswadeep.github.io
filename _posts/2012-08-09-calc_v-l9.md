### Lecture Notes on Second Order Conditions II: Advanced Concepts

#### Part 1: Introduction to Advanced Second Order Conditions

Today, we continue our exploration into the calculus of variations, focusing on advanced second order conditions. We delve deeper into the theoretical underpinnings that distinguish local minimizers from other types of extremals, using more complex examples to illustrate these concepts.

**1. Recap and Expansion of Second Order Conditions**

We begin by revisiting the foundational concept that a $C^2$ Lagrangian, $L : [a, b] \times \mathbb{R}^n \times \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, leads to a functional $J$ defined by:

$$ J(\xi) = \int_a^b L(t, \xi(t), \xi'(t)) dt. $$

Given a $C^1$ local minimizer $\bar{\xi} : [a, b] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ with fixed endpoints for $J$, for any $C^1$ curve $\eta : [a, b] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ where $\eta(a) = \eta(b) = 0$, we demonstrated that $g_{\eta}(h) = J(\bar{\xi} + h\eta)$ has a local minimum at $h = 0$, leading to the conditions $g'_{\eta}(0) = 0$ and $g''_{\eta}(0) \geq 0$.

**2. Legendre Condition: A Revisit**

The Legendre condition, which states that $L_{qq}(t, \bar{\xi}(t), \bar{\xi}'(t))$ is positive semi-definite for any $t \in [a, b]$, was shown to be a necessary but not sufficient condition for local minimality. We use the Wirtinger example to emphasize this point:

- **Example (Wirtinger):** The Lagrangian $L(x, q) = q^2 - x^2$ is $C^\infty$ and $C^2$-strictly convex but not Tonelli since it is not bounded from below in $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}$. Despite the strong Legendre condition being satisfied ($L_{qq} \equiv 2 > 0$ everywhere), the example demonstrates that this condition alone does not guarantee local minimality.

**3. Understanding the Jacobi Equation**

The discussion leads to the introduction of the Jacobi equation, a pivotal concept in identifying local minimizers. The Jacobi equation, arising from a refined analysis of second order variations, is critical in understanding the conditions under which an extremal can be considered a local minimizer.

- **Jacobi Equation:** Derived from the analysis of $g''_{\eta}(0)$, the Jacobi equation is a linear second-order ODE whose solutions help determine the presence of conjugate points, which are indicators of potential failure in local minimality.

**4. Conjugate Points and Jacobi's Theorem**

Conjugate points play a central role in the calculus of variations. These are points $c \in (a, b]$ for which there exists a nontrivial solution $\zeta$ of the Jacobi equation, satisfying $\zeta(a) = \zeta(c) = 0$.

- **Jacobi's Theorem:** This theorem establishes a sufficient condition for local minimality, relating the absence of conjugate points to a given extremal with the property of being a local minimizer.

**5. Application to the Wirtinger Example**

Applying Jacobi's theorem to the Wirtinger example, we find that for $T > \pi$, no local minimizers exist due to the presence of conjugate points. However, for $T < \pi$, the unique extremal $\bar{\xi} \equiv 0$ is identified as a local (and, under certain conditions, global) minimizer, showcasing the theorem's utility in practical scenarios.

**6. Wirtinger Inequality: A Powerful Tool**

The Wirtinger inequality emerges as a crucial tool in establishing the global minimality of certain functions, offering a significant improvement over previous bounds derived from the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. This inequality is particularly effective in cases where traditional methods fall short, providing a clear pathway to determining global minimizers in complex variational problems.

**7. Moving Forward**

As we delve further into the nuances of second order conditions, we uncover a rich landscape of mathematical concepts and tools essential for a deeper understanding of the calculus of variations. Through examples like the Wirtinger case, we learn not only about the limitations of certain conditions but also about the innovative approaches developed to overcome

### Part 2: Jacobi's Condition and the Concept of Conjugate Points

In this part of our lecture, we'll explore Jacobi's condition and the concept of conjugate points in greater detail. These concepts are central to understanding the nuanced criteria for determining local minimizers in the calculus of variations.

**1. Jacobi's Condition Explored**

Jacobi's condition, arising from the detailed analysis of the second variation of the action, $g''_{\eta}(0)$, introduces a linear second-order differential equation, known as the Jacobi equation:

$$ -\frac{d}{dt}\left(P(t)\zeta'(t)\right) + Q(t)\zeta(t) = 0, $$

where $P(t) = L_{qq}(t, \bar{\xi}(t), \bar{\xi}'(t))$ and $Q(t)$ is derived from the Lagrangian's second-order partial derivatives, taking into account the integration by parts performed during the analysis.

**2. Understanding Conjugate Points**

Conjugate points are defined relative to an extremal, marking positions where the associated Jacobi field (solution to the Jacobi equation) vanishes, aside from the initial point. The presence of conjugate points within the interval of study can signal the failure of an extremal to be a local minimizer.

- **Definition (Conjugate Point):** A point $c \in (a, b]$ is called a conjugate point to $a$ for the Lagrangian $L$ if there exists a nontrivial solution $\zeta$ of the Jacobi equation on $[a, c]$ such that $\zeta(a) = \zeta(c) = 0$.

**3. Jacobi's Theorem in Depth**

Jacobi's theorem offers a critical insight into the nature of local minimizers, stating that if no point conjugate to $a$ exists in $]a, b]$, and if $P(t)$ is positive definite for all $t \in [a, b]$, then the extremal is a local minimizer. Conversely, if an extremal is a local minimizer and $P(t)$ is positive definite, then no point in $]a, b[$ is conjugate to $a$.

- **Implication:** This theorem delineates a clear boundary between the existence of conjugate points and the potential for an extremal to serve as a local minimizer, providing a robust framework for analyzing complex variational problems.

**4. Application and Examples**

Let's revisit the Wirtinger example with a new perspective offered by Jacobi's theorem. The special form of the Lagrangian $L(x, q) = q^2 - x^2$ leads to extremals of the form $\xi(t) = \alpha \sin(t)$, with the associated Jacobi equation mirroring the Euler equation. This symmetry is rare but illuminates the path to identifying conjugate points and understanding their implications for local minimality.

- **Wirtinger Example Revisited:** For $T < \pi$, the absence of conjugate points implies that the trivial solution $\bar{\xi} \equiv 0$ is a local minimizer. This result is further reinforced by the Wirtinger inequality, establishing the trivial solution as a global minimizer under these conditions.

**5. The Wirtinger Inequality**

The Wirtinger inequality plays a pivotal role in this context, offering a powerful tool for assessing the global minimality of functions within the scope of the calculus of variations:

$$ \int_a^b \|\xi(t)\|^2 dt \leq \frac{(b - a)^2}{\pi^2} \int_a^b \|\xi'(t)\|^2 dt, $$

with equality if and only if $\xi(t) = v \sin\left(\frac{\pi(t - a)}{b - a}\right)$ for some $v \in \mathbb{R}^n$.

- **Implications for Global Minimality:** This inequality not only refines previous bounds derived from the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality but also provides a direct pathway to confirming global minimizers for certain problems, as exemplified by the analysis of the Wirtinger example for $T < \pi$.

**6. Conclusion of Part 2**

Through the detailed exploration of Jacobi's condition, conjugate points, and the application of the Wirtinger inequality, we gain a deeper understanding of the mechanisms that govern the calculus of variations. These advanced concepts not only enrich our mathematical toolkit but also sharpen our analytical skills, enabling us to tackle more complex problems with confidence and rigor.

In the upcoming part, we'll delve into the proofs and further applications of these principles, solidifying our grasp on the nuanced landscape of second-order conditions in the calculus of variations.



### Part 3: Proofs and Further Insights into Jacobi's Theorem and Wirtinger's Inequality

In the final part of our exploration into second order conditions, we delve into the proofs of Jacobi's Theorem and the Wirtinger Inequality. These proofs not only solidify our understanding of these fundamental concepts but also provide further insights into their applicability in solving variational problems.

**1. The Essence of Jacobi's Theorem**

Jacobi's Theorem is foundational in identifying the conditions under which an extremal can serve as a local minimizer. The theorem is based on the absence of conjugate points within the interval under consideration and the positivity of the second variation.

- **Proof Sketch of Jacobi's Theorem:**
  - The key lies in the analysis of the second variation of the functional, which leads to the Jacobi equation. If no conjugate points exist, this implies that the second variation remains positive for all admissible variations, hence indicating local minimality.
  - Conversely, if an extremal is a local minimizer, the positivity of the second variation throughout the interval implies that no conjugate points can exist. This is because conjugate points would introduce directions along which the second variation could become zero or negative, contradicting local minimality.

**2. Application to the Wirtinger Example Revisited**

With Jacobi's theorem in hand, we revisit the Wirtinger example, which serves as a perfect illustration of how these theoretical concepts apply in practical scenarios.

- For $T < \pi$, the unique extremal $\bar{\xi} \equiv 0$ is not only a local minimizer but, as demonstrated by the Wirtinger Inequality, also a global minimizer. This outcome is due to the absence of conjugate points and the inequality's confirmation that no other curve can provide a lower value for the functional $J$.

**3. The Wirtinger Inequality Detailed**

The Wirtinger Inequality is a powerful tool in the analysis of variational problems, providing a bound on the integral of a function in terms of its derivative.

- **Proof of Wirtinger's Inequality:**
  - The proof is elegantly derived by considering the function $\xi$ and its derivative $\xi'$ within the context of the Fourier series. By constraining $\xi$ to satisfy $\xi(a) = \xi(b) = 0$, we effectively limit the Fourier expansion to sine terms only.
  - Analyzing the energy associated with $\xi$ and its derivative via Parseval's theorem, we find that the inequality naturally arises from the comparison of the energy stored in the function versus its derivative, emphasizing the fundamental nature of oscillatory functions and their energy distribution.

**4. Further Insights and Implications**

The discussions around Jacobi's theorem and the Wirtinger Inequality highlight a deeper philosophical aspect of the calculus of variations: the interplay between geometry, analysis, and physics. These tools not only allow us to solve mathematical problems but also provide insights into the physical world, where principles of minimality and equilibrium govern the behavior of systems.

- **Beyond the Mathematics:**
  - The applications of these concepts extend far beyond purely academic exercises. They are fundamental in understanding the stability of structures, the behavior of mechanical and electrical systems, and even the principles underlying the universe itself.

**5. Conclusion and Forward Look**

As we conclude our lecture series on second order conditions, it's clear that the journey through the calculus of variations is both rich and complex. The principles of Jacobi and Wirtinger serve as beacons, guiding us through the intricate landscape of mathematical analysis and its applications.

Looking ahead, the tools and concepts we've explored open the door to further study and discovery in fields as diverse as quantum mechanics, general relativity, and beyond. The calculus of variations, with its deep connections to the fundamental laws of physics and mathematics, remains a vibrant area of research and exploration.

As we venture forward, let the curiosity and rigor that have guided our studies continue to lead the way, always remembering that behind every equation, theorem, or inequality lies a story of discovery, insight, and the relentless pursuit of understanding.

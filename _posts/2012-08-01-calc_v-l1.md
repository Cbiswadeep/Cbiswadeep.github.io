# Calculus of Variations: An Introduction

## Lecture Notes for the First Class

Welcome to the first class on Calculus of Variations, a fascinating branch of mathematics that explores how to find functions that minimize or maximize certain quantities. This course requires no prior knowledge in the subject, but a solid understanding of basic calculus and linear algebra will be beneficial.

## Preliminaries

Before diving into the calculus of variations, let's start with some foundational concepts. We operate in the $n$-dimensional Euclidean space, $\mathbb{R}^n$, where points can be denoted by coordinates $(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)$. The Euclidean norm and the scalar product are given by:

$\|x\| = \sqrt{x_1^2 + x_2^2 + ... + x_n^2} \quad \text{and} \quad \langle x, y\rangle = x_1y_1 + x_2y_2 + ... + x_ny_n,$

respectively. These notions are essential for understanding distances and angles between vectors in our space.

## Derivative and Partial Derivatives

The derivative of a function $f: \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^m$ at a point gives us the rate at which $f$ changes at that point. For functions of multiple variables, partial derivatives describe how $f$ changes as each variable is varied individually while keeping the others constant.

The Jacobian matrix collects all first-order partial derivatives of a vector-valued function, offering a way to study how a multivariable function changes directionally at a point in its domain.

## The Gradient and Hessian

For real-valued functions ($m=1$), the gradient ($\nabla f$) points in the direction of the steepest ascent of $f$. The Hessian matrix, which is the square matrix of second-order partial derivatives, describes the local curvature of $f$. These concepts are vital for understanding optimization problems.

## Curves in $\mathbb{R}^n$

A curve or arc in $\mathbb{R}^n$ is represented by a function from an interval in $\mathbb{R}$ to $\mathbb{R}^n$. The differentiability of such curves plays a crucial role in calculus of variations, as we often seek curves that minimize or maximize certain properties, like length or energy.

## Basic Problems in Calculus of Variations

The calculus of variations deals with finding functions that optimize certain quantities. This can be illustrated with several classic problems:

1. **The Length Minimization Problem**: Finding the shortest path between two points.
2. **The Soap Bubble Problem**: Finding the surface of minimal area that spans a given contour.
3. **The Action Minimization Problem**: Identifying the path that a physical system will follow based on the principle of least action.
4. **The Brachistochrone Problem**: Determining the curve of quickest descent under gravity between two points.

These problems all involve minimizing a functional, a function that takes another function as its input.

## The General Setting

The framework for the calculus of variations involves considering a set of admissible functions and seeking the function(s) within this set that minimize (or maximize) a given functional. This functional typically incorporates the integral of a function over a domain, possibly along with additional terms representing constraints or boundary conditions.

A function that minimizes the functional is called a **minimizer**, and understanding the conditions under which a minimizer exists and how to find it is a central aim of the calculus of variations.

## Concluding Remarks

As we progress through this course, we will explore the techniques for finding minimizers, the conditions under which they exist, and how to apply these principles to solve practical problems in physics, engineering, and beyond. The beauty of calculus of variations lies in its ability to frame and solve problems that span across the realms of mathematics and the physical sciences. 

Next time, we'll dive deeper into the Euler-Lagrange equation, the cornerstone for finding extremals of functionals, and explore its applications in various fields. Stay tuned, and welcome to the world of calculus of variations!

## Research Vision

Real-world artificial intelligence (AI) faces a fundamental challenge: while AI systems excel in controlled environments, they struggle with the unpredictable dynamics of real-world settings. Current autonomous systems rely on periodic retraining and human intervention, which renders them brittle when facing environmental shiftsâ€”autonomous vehicles falter in unexpected weather, medical systems struggle with new disease variants, and robots fail in novel scenarios.

My research introduces a fundamentally new perspective: treating AI as a dynamical system that naturally evolves and adapts. This framework embeds adaptability and resilience within the model's core, enabling continuous, asynchronous learning and self-sustaining operation. By redefining AI through the lens of dynamical systems theory, we move beyond traditional static models toward systems that behave more like self-sustaining organisms, capable of evolving in response to environmental changes.

### Research Thrusts

#### 1. Learning Algorithms as Adaptive Control Systems
My research addresses real-time adaptability by embedding adaptive control directly within learning algorithms, especially through SNNs. Key achievements include:
- Development of Heterogeneous Recurrent SNNs (HRSNNs) with enhanced temporal memory retention
- Introduction of Lyapunov Noise Pruning (LNP), achieving neuron sparsity up to 57%
- Creation of RoboKoop, integrating Koopman operator theory for enhanced off-policy control

#### 2. Dynamic Model Architecture
My work promotes dynamic, evolving architectures that balance complexity and efficiency, demonstrated through:
- Development of DNN-SNN hybrid object detection models with 3x power reduction
- Creation of SPLR network achieving 70x reduction in FLOPs
- Implementation of architecture search with uncertainty regularization
- Development of STEMFold for multi-agent systems with hidden agents

#### 3. Model and Platform Co-Design
Focusing on creating computationally efficient, adaptive systems through:
- Development of the MONETA Processing-in-Memory platform
- Contribution to SATori, a k-SAT accelerator using Stochastic Recurrent Neural Networks
- Collaboration on Oscillator Ising Machines for energy-efficient optimization

### Future Research Directions

My research focuses on two critical areas that push the boundaries of adaptive AI:

#### Self-Healing AI for Autonomous Space Exploration
Developing adaptive neuromorphic models capable of autonomously adjusting to changing conditions and recovering from hardware faults in extreme space environments, where human intervention is impractical.

#### Resilient AI for Real-Time Disaster Response
Creating adaptive, resilient AI systems that can autonomously reorganize in real-time for disaster response operations, capable of maintaining stability despite component failures and rapidly changing conditions.

Through this research, I aim to establish a foundation for AI systems that can learn and operate autonomously throughout their lifetime, advancing the field toward truly adaptive AI that can thrive in complex, uncertain environments.

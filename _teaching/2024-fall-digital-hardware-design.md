In Fall 2024, I will have the opportunity to serve as the Instructor of Record for ECE 2020, focusing on Digital Hardware Design, specifically tailored for non-ECE majors. This role involves not just lecturing, but also comprehensive course management including the creation of the syllabus, scheduling, assignment development, and examination.

Heading 1: Course Overview
======
The course introduces students to the fundamentals of digital logic and hardware design. Topics covered include binary systems, logic gates, combinational and sequential logic, and an introduction to FPGA-based design.

Heading 2: Teaching Philosophy
======
My teaching approach is centered on engaging students through practical applications of theoretical concepts. I integrate real-world examples to illustrate the relevance of digital hardware design in today's technology-driven landscape.

Heading 3: Student Engagement
======
To foster an interactive learning environment, I employ a mix of lectures, hands-on lab sessions, and group projects. I encourage students to explore digital design through collaborative projects that solve real problems, preparing them for challenges they may face in the tech industry.

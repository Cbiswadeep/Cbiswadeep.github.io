This talk at the IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC) presented a novel approach to EEG signal classification using a phase-sensitive common spatial pattern. The methodology enhances the ability to differentiate between various mental states, offering improved performance in brain-computer interface applications. The discussion included results from recent studies and potential implications for future research.

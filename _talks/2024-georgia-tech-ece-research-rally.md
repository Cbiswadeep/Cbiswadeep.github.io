This talk focused on giving an motivation for brain-inspired computing and neuromorphic computing to undergraduate students and discuss the capabilities of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) for advancing online learning mechanisms. The discussion included the temporal dynamics and computational advantages of SNNs, aiming to illustrate how these biological-inspired systems can lead to more efficient and robust artificial intelligence technologies.

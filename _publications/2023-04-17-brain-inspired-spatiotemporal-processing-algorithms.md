Neuromorphic engineering, particularly event-based cameras, stands at the forefront of replicating the human perceptual system's efficiency and effectiveness. Our work centers on bridging the gap between the potential of these bio-plausible sensing systems and their practical application in the real world. We delve into the realm of brain-inspired algorithms, notably spiking neural networks (SNNs), and their capacity to efficiently process spatiotemporal sequences without relying on complex recurrent structures.

Our discussion extends to the event-driven nature of these algorithms, illustrating how they can be formulated for both training and inference to achieve real-time throughput on commercially available hardware. Furthermore, we present a model of a brain-inspired recurrent SNN tailored for data from event cameras, showcasing its performance and potential applications. One of the pivotal aspects of our talk involves exploring the use of associative memory structures, which play a crucial role in building efficient representations for event-based perception.

This presentation not only highlights our recent efforts in the development of spatiotemporal processing algorithms but also points to the promising future of neuromorphic computing in creating low-power, high-efficiency perception systems akin to human sensory processes.
